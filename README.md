Collection of miscellaneous Python scripts

This also includes a runScript to execute a jupyter for easy coding of python

## Use without nix

## stacked Bars
This script has the goal to draw data into a graph of stacked data. This is for example useful if you want to show a execution time is distributed over parts of a program and compare this distribution between different implementations of the algorithm. As this is about execution time error bars are included to indicate standard deviation.
